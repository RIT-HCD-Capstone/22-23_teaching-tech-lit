	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>
		Current technological literacy programs are for young children (6-12) or if it is for adults it
		is only job skills training. We are instead looking to teach adults tech intuition and literacy,
		rather than focusing on programs like Office or Adobe. Older people who did not grow up with
		computers and tech face the biggest gap in technological literacy.
