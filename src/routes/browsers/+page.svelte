	<p>Search bar</p>
	<p>
		The search bar is a text box that lets you search a website or the internet for information.
		Typically the textbox will have a magnifying glass as an icon for you to click and begin typing
		anything you want to look for. An example of this is the text box on the google homepage.
	</p>

	<p>
		Tabs - Many browsers use tabs to help moving back and forth between multiple webpages quick and
		easy. They usually look like this. You can open a new tab yourself by right clicking on a link
		and selecting “open in new tab.”
	</p>

	<p>Scroll bar</p>
	<p>
		A scroll bar is a visual representation of how far down a webpage you are. They are typically
		shown as a thin dark colored bar on the right of the browser that allows you to scroll up and
		down the page by dragging it. As you scroll down, the bar follows to keep track of how far
		you’ve scrolled.
	</p>
	<p>
		Menu - A menu is a collection of buttons that can look like this(across the top) or this(along
		the side) or this(hamburger/collapsed). Here you can find the next parts of a website we will
		talk about.
	</p>
	<p>
		Refresh - This is a refresh button, it can be found on most browsers, and it is usually shown by
		an arrow circling back on itself. While a page is loading this arrow turns into an X you can
		click this while the page is loading to stop the page from loading.
	</p>
	<p>
		Arrows - These are the navigation arrows, there is a back (left pointing) arrow and a forward
		(right) facing arrow. The back arrow will take you back to the previous webpage you were on if
		possible. The forward arrow will return you to the page you were on before you pressed the back
		arrow if you haven’t navigated to any other webpages.
	</p>
	<p>
		Bookmarks - Bookmarks are a very useful feature of browsers that allow you to remember web pages
		you like to go to often. Like a normal bookmark, they can save your place so you can go back and
		read the page. Typically in the top right corner of the browser there is a star to bookmark a
		page, letting you go back to the page at a later time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Top left corner down arrow - this allows you to search in your tabs, it is a feature on safari
		and chrome
