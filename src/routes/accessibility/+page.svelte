		Zoom in - many web browsers have built in zoom capabilities, these can be found in the settings
		on the browser, signified by a magnifying glass. If you are on a laptop with a trackpad you can
		change the zoom by putting two fingers on the pad, and moving them away from each other to zoom
		in. To zoom out with this method put two fingers on the trackpad and bring your fingers
		together.
